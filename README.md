# Physi.cs

A 2D physics engine, simulating physical systems in digital environments.

Currently building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

```bash
# verify C# and .NET SDK is installed locally
dotnet

# install MonoGame templates
dotnet new --install MonoGame.Templates.CSharp
```

Quick setup to build and run:

```bash
# for 2D physics-related items, check out engine
cd engine

# for helper operations, check out flat
cd flat

# for tests and simulations, check out tests
cd tests

# go into the project, then build
dotnet build

# go into the project, then run
dotnet run
```

## Technologies Used

- C#
- MonoGame

## Background

After building [Jonin](https://github.com/aaronkjin/jonin) (a ninja platformer game) with PyGame, I became curious on how game engines work. I aim to capture and explore upon this curiosity with this project, specifically in relation to how physics is simulated in game-like environments: whether it be a character walking/running, an enemy jumping, an object falling, etc.
